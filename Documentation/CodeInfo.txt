How the code is setup:

In an effort to increase readablitly code is organized into multiple python files

Server.python

-When the client gives input it goes here and the server redirects it to the appropriate function

GameCommands.python

User.py

-Handles the user class and all the functions that are used by the user class

Tile.py

-Handles the tile class and all the functions that are used by the tile class

-Runs a test to see if the server can handle multiple clients at once
